## <p align="center">nolimitcarter's .config files (dotfiles) for Linux and OS X</p>

**Warning:** This build is passing but will more than likely never be complete. It still has a lot of problems with Windows and OS X because the development was done on Linux and some of the aliases are based on bash. A lot of the things commented out are WIPs or have been forgotten about. I will get to them sometime...

## Info

Alacritty terminal used with Bash, Tmux, Vim, Mutt, Lynx, etc. and the many different additions added to each configuration file. Bash, Tmux, and Alacritty combined make the possibilities limitless with productivity and speed. The Bash and Vim configs above have many different features including autocomplete for text, go to file which is one of my remaps, and nerdtree which allows you to look at all directories at once and swtich between them quickly.  

Most folders are OS specific besides the main repo itself. It is an Ubuntu config.
## Distro

I mainly use Ubuntu GNOME but am working to get this config setup on OS X.
