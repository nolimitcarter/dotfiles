## <p align="center">nolimitcarter's .config files (dotfiles) for Linux and OS X</p>

ðŸŽ’ Hello! Thanks for visiting! This is my personal configuration for i3 window manager and some other applications too. More details below. 

âœ¨ **Warning:** This build is passing but will more than likely never be complete. Here are all of my distro configs.

## Info
Screenshots: Top: Manjaro with i3wm and polybar. Other 3: Ubuntu with gtile

Alacritty terminal used with Bash, Tmux, Vim, Mutt, Lynx, etc. and the many different additions added to each configuration file. Bash, Tmux, and Alacritty combined make the possibilities limitless with productivity and speed. The Bash and Vim configs above have many different features including autocomplete for text, go to file which is one of my remaps, and nerdtree which allows you to look at all directories at once and swtich between them quickly.  

Most folders are OS specific besides the main repo itself. It is an Ubuntu config.

Also, my polybar config is heavily inspired by DistroTube since most of his colors are ones I acitively use.
