# Lynx Text Browser FTW!

It might be the oldest web browser currently under active maintenance but it is still hands down the single best browser for rapid research. Lynx does not even look at the bloat of images, CSS, and JavaScript when loading making it objectively the fastest possible way to browse the text of web sites. When combined with a `?` (`duck`) and `??` (`google`) command you fill find results to documentation queries and technical documentation as fast as it takes to open a local `man` page.
